Henry Homework : Backend FrontEnd Explanation

Front end is like my experience on facebook with my profile or like Amazon with my purchasing accounnt. Everything i do on each is my front end user experience. The back end makes those functions happen. When i click on anything on either site it is communicating with the backend which grabs the specific information from the server.
